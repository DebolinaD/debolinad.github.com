							Am sure the name “Full stack developer” surprises you.

							I heard about it may be a day back and was amazed. 
							
							I mean is it not against what we have been convinced throughout our life. 
							
							Learn one thing, specialize and do the same repetitive things.
						<p>
						</p>
							I enjoy working out difficult algorithms, something that makes you say <a title="Total Years" target="_self" href="#">wow</a> once thats done.
						</p>
						<p>
							 I fell in love with web development long back after I had passed out from my college. I was using php at that time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later I shifted to application development using Dot Net. 
						
							I really enjoy easy to use Visual Studio and have used Silverlight and WCF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently I fell in love with the power of jQuery.
						</p>
						<p>

						<p>
							Beyond work, I enjoy reading books. 
							Though music is not my passion I like music.  When I am stuck with some difficult problems, music helps to soothe me.
