excerpt: Am sure the name “Full stack developer” surprises you.

		I heard about it may be a day back and was amazed. 
							
		I mean is it not against what we have been convinced throughout our life. 
							
		Learn one thing, specialize and do the same repetitive things.

							Am sure the name “Full stack developer” surprises you.

							I heard about it may be a day back and was amazed. 
							
							I mean is it not against what we have been convinced throughout our life. 
							
							Learn one thing, specialize and do the same repetitive things.

							I enjoy working out difficult algorithms, something that makes you say <a title="Total Years" target="_self" href="#">wow</a> once thats done.
						</p>
						<p>
							 I fell in love with web development long back after I had passed out from my college. I was using php at that time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later I shifted to application development using Dot Net. 
						
							I really enjoy easy to use Visual Studio and have used Silverlight and WCF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently I fell in love with the power of jQuery.

							Beyond work, I enjoy reading books. 
							Though music is not my passion I like music.  When I am stuck with some difficult problems, music helps to soothe me.
