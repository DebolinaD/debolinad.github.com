excerpt: A Full stack developer - a developer who can create a non trivial application all by himself, not depending on any one else.
---
  <p>Am sure the name &#8220;Full stack developer&#8221; surprises you.</p>

  <p>I heard about it may be a day back and was amazed. I mean is it not against what we have been convinced throughout our life. Learn one thing, specialize and do the same repetitive things.</p>

  <p>I liked the way, Carlos Bueno, an engineer at Facebook spoke about FullStack Developers, in his blog The Full Stack, Part I . He said,</p>

  <p>A &#8220;full-stack programmer&#8221; is a generalist, someone who can create a non-trivial application by themselves. People who develop broad skills also tend to develop a good mental model of how different layers of a system behave. This turns out to be especially valuable for performance &amp; optimization work. No one can know everything about everything, but you should be able to visualize what happens up and down the stack as an application does its thing. An application is shaped by the requirements of its data, and performance is shaped by how quickly hardware can throw data around.</p>

  <p>Having said that all, I plan to do loads of things.</p>

Firstly, learning things it requires for a complete web developer and use this blog to help me remember the knowledge I gathered.

  <p>Secondly, will try innovating new things, which can be used not only for learning but also for real life scenarios</p>

  <p>Of course am sure this blog will also help other to learn and of course innovate.</p>
