							I have been working as an application developer for <a id="counter" title="Total Years" target="_self" href="#"></a>.
						<script type="text/javascript">new CountUp('June 01, 2009 13:11:20','counter');</script>

							Phew thats long time..!!! Trust me am not <a title="Total Years" target="_self" href="#">BORED</a>.
						<p>
						</p>
							I enjoy working out difficult algorithms, something that makes you say <a title="Total Years" target="_self" href="#">wow</a> once thats done.

							 I fell in love with web development long back after I had passed out from my college. I was using php at that time.
						</p>
						<p>
							Later I shifted to application development using Dot Net. 
						
							I really enjoy easy to use Visual Studio and have used Silverlight and WCF.
						</p>
						<p>
							Recently I fell in love with the power of jQuery.

						<p>
							Beyond work, I enjoy reading books. 
							Though music is not my passion I like music.  When I am stuck with some difficult problems, music helps to soothe me.
